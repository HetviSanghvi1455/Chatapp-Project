Yeah.The blood vesselsinflate like a balloonon hot days to give off heat,and then they shrink oncold days to maintaintheir body temperatures.- Whoa!And here I was thinkingthat the long earswere just so that you fuzzyfolks could hear better.- Oh, they work for that, too.Bunny ears are also designedfor excellent hearing.- So do bunnies havebetter hearing than humans?- Mmm, kind of.You see, when it comesto low vibration counts,a bunny's hearing ability isabout the same as a human,but when it comes tohigh vibration counts,bunnies can hear thosefrom up to two miles away.- You have like super ears!- For the most part,but only because thosehigh vibration counts,also known as frequencies,would be totally quietto the human ear.- What about myears?

Where is she?- She's over in the Egg Forest.Just phase on over.Tell her I sent ya.- Thanks, Bert.- No worries.And good luck, amigo.(chimes ringing)- Hey, hey, Goldie girl.- Why, Pinocchio!What brings you all the wayout here to the Egg Forest?- I have a question for you.- You do?

How did you know?Are you a psychic or something?- No, but I guessyou have seen it?- I sure have.- Holy nostrils!Please, tell me what happened.- So Cheshire's body findsits way here sometimesbecause it can't seewhere it's going.- Why does it come here?- Because it sometimesmistakes are Easter basketsas litter boxes.- Um. Ew?- You're tellingme. Ew. (laughing)Anyway, it startedhappening so oftenthat we started leaving specificbaskets in specific places.Cats are creaturesof habit, you know?- Oh, those poordefenseless wicker baskets,just sitting there,waiting to be pooped in.It breaks my heart.- You can communicatewith wicker?- Yes ma'am.I am made out of wood, you know?- Hmm.Good point.- Anyway.- Anyway. (chuckling)Cheshire's body washere scratching aroundthat basket over there.I turned my backfor just a second.Then I heard thisstrange whooshing sound.I turned around andhis body was gone.Vanished into thin air.- Hmm. (sniffing)I smell something funny.- You do? (sniffing)Hmm.I don't.- That's because you're notin tune with the wicker.I am.And that basketyou're talking aboutthat Cheshire's body was inhas a very distinct smell.- It doesn't.What does it smell like?- Tea.- Tea?You mean like the drink tea?- Yep. Bingo.That's very interesting.- How come?- Because the Hatter'stea set is missing, too.- So three things are missing?- Yep. Cupid's bow,the Hatter's tea set,and Cheshire's body.- What in the world do thosethree things have in common?- I'm thinkingBlunderboar the Giant,who we know took Cupid's bow,is using them as somesort of magic spell.We just don't know why.- What are you gonna do next?- To be honest, I'm not sure.- I wish I could havebeen more helpful.- Are you kidding?You've been great.I'm gonna head back tothe Starship Fairy Dust,report in to Captain SnowWhite, and have her decide.- Now that soundslike a good idea.- Thanks, Goldie.- Anytime, Pinocchio. Good luck.- [Snow White]Captain's travel log,star date 78-69-14, hike!Pinocchio has returnedto the ship to sharewhat he's learned.It's not much, but at leastit sounds as if the dotsare slowly being connected.- So the litter basket onEasterland smelled like tea?- Maybe Cheshire'sbody was drinking teaand had to go potty.- The body doesn'teven have a head.How could it go potty?- Nature will finda way! (chuckling)Seriously though, being thatthe basket smelled like tea,I'm nearly positivethis has something to dowith Hatter's missing tea set.- And that, Pinocchio, iswhy you're my first mate.- Aye, aye, Captain.What's our next move?- Well, we have been toCupid's and tracked downthe last seen whereaboutsof Cheshire's body.That leaves one moreplace to investigate.- We're headingback to Wonderland?- Hush.I am the captain.Ahem.We're heading backto Wonderland.- Um, good idea?- That's why I'm the captain.Robin, set a coursefor Wonderland.It's time to talk with Hatter.- Fairy Tale FunForce to the rescue.(warp speed warbling)- [Narrator] Andquick as a flash,the Fairy Tale FunForce speeds backto the Wonderland galaxyto interview one ofthe craziest charactersin the entire universe.The Hatter.Some say that the Hatter's teaset is one of the only thingsto keep himconnected to reality.Will he be evencrazier without it?Let's find out.- Hey!Yoo-hoo!Captain Snow White here.Official FairytaleFun Force business.Hello?Where is everyone?(chimes ringing)- Humans have been performingdentistry since 7,000 BC,which makes dentists oneof the oldest professions.- Um.Huh?- Apples, peaches andraspberries are all membersof the rose family.- Hatter, are you okay?- Oh, thank heavenshelp is here.Yeah, he's beenlike this all day.- Canada eats moremacaroni and cheesethan any othernation in the world.- Been like what?What's he talking about?- Ever since his tea set wentmissing, he's short-circuited.He's just been running roundspoutin' strange facts.- Are the facts, though?- An animal's yawn is basedon how large their brain is.The bigger the brain, thelonger they will yawn.- I mean, I think that they are.- Dinosaurs would swallowlarge rocks which stayedin their stomach to helpchurn and digest food.- So weird.Anyway, I'm glad tosee that you're stillof this world, Dormouse.- I am, but I have noidea how much longerI can put up with Hatter'sbarrage of strange factoids!- Surgeons who play videogames at least three hoursa week performed 27% fasterand make 37% fewer errors.- What can you tellme about the timewhen the tea set went missing?- Well, everyone wasjust sitting down to tea.Even the whiterabbit was on time.Had to turn aroundto get some biscuits,and we heard thisstrange whooshing sound.- A strawberry isnot an actual berry,but a banana is.- What kind of awhooshing sound?- Like an arrow flyingthrough the air.- In Israel it is illegalto bring bears to the beach.- Apples and mirrors!That makes sense!- What does?That it's against the lawto bring bears to the beach?- Well yeah, but that's notwhat I meant.

(chuckling)- No kidding! (laughing)Old Foxy told Blunderpantsthat Dorothy wasgonna put on aflying monkey show.That got Blunderboar'spants in a bunch.- Why does he have somethingagainst flying monkeys?- Apparently flying monkeyslove to eat giant earwax.It's like a delicacyor something.- Um.Ew.- Totally. Ew.Giants need their earwaxso that their earsdon't pop when they'reat high altitudes,but being that they're so tall,giants are alwaysat high altitudes.Without their earwax,their heads would benon-stop popping.- And because of this,Blunderboar decidedto stop Dorothy from puttingon the flying monkey show.- Correct.- I'm almost afraid to ask,but how did he go aboutstopping the show?Did you ask him to stop?- Mirrors and apples, we tried.But just like the magicbow, he's hidden. (laughing)First, he boostedCupid's magic bowfrom the Love Planetand then he used itto shoot a magic arrowthrough the Hatter's tea setin Wonderland, thereby soakingsaid magic arrow in tea,and then he usedthat tea-soaked arrowto bamboozle the bodyof the Cheshire Cat,who was the finalmagic ingredient neededto lock Dorothy in Oz.- Holy one upmushrooms!
